# ImageRipper
Can download repetitive links from online textbooks aka knooppunt/scoodle
I'm not responsible for what you download with this tool or if you get ip-banned/your account gets disabled

just use your dev tools > network to see the images being downloaded and input them without the number.png part at the end
